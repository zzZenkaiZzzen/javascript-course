## üå§Ô∏è Section 1: Weather Forecast Challenge

### **The Main Challenge**

This is a complex problem that tests all your developer skills. Apply the 4-step framework methodically - don't jump straight to coding!

**Problem Statement:**

```
Given an array of forecasted maximum temperatures, create a function that
displays a formatted string with these temperatures.

EXAMPLE:
Input: [17, 21, 23]
Output: "...17¬∞C in 1 days...21¬∞C in 2 days...23¬∞C in 3 days..."

REQUIREMENTS:
- Function name: printForecast(arr)
- Log formatted string to console
- Handle arrays of any length
- Day numbering starts at 1 (not 0)
- Include temperature symbol and proper formatting

TEST DATA:
- Test 1: [17, 21, 23]
- Test 2: [12, 5, -5, 0, 4]
```

### **Apply the 4-Step Framework**

**STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM**
Key questions to ask yourself:

- How do we transform an array into a formatted string?
- What's the pattern for day numbering? (index + 1)
- How do we handle the separator dots?
- What's the exact format for each temperature entry?

**STEP 2: DIVIDE INTO SUB-PROBLEMS**
Break down the challenge:

1. Transform array into string (main task)
2. Format each element as "temperature¬∞C in X days"
3. Add day numbering (index + 1)
4. Add separator dots between elements
5. Add dots at start and end of string
6. Log final string to console

### **Implementation**

Start with test data:

```javascript
////////////////////////////////////
// MAIN CHALLENGE: Weather Forecast String Builder

/*
WEATHER FORECAST CHALLENGE:
Apply 4-step framework systematically:
1. UNDERSTAND: Transform array to formatted string with day numbering
2. DIVIDE: String building + formatting + day calculation + separators
3. RESEARCH: String concatenation and template literals
4. IMPLEMENT: Step-by-step solution building
*/

const data1 = [17, 21, 23];
const data2 = [12, 5, -5, 0, 4];

function printForecast(arr) {
  // Start with empty string accumulator - same pattern as sum calculations
  let str = "";

  // Loop through array to build the formatted string
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    // Build each piece using template literals for clean formatting
    str += `${arr[i]}¬∞C in ${i + 1} days ... `;
  }

  // Add starting dots and log the final result
  console.log("..." + str);
}

// Test with provided data
printForecast(data1);
printForecast(data2);

console.log("Weather forecast formatter working correctly!");
```

### **Alternative Approaches**

Professional developers consider multiple solutions:

```javascript
////////////////////////////////////
// ALTERNATIVE IMPLEMENTATIONS

// Alternative 1 - Using array methods instead of loops
function printForecastMap(arr) {
  const formatted = arr.map((temp, index) => `${temp}¬∞C in ${index + 1} days`);
  console.log("..." + formatted.join(" ... ") + " ...");
}

// Alternative 2 - Single line approach using reduce
function printForecastReduce(arr) {
  const result = arr.reduce(
    (acc, temp, index) => acc + `${temp}¬∞C in ${index + 1} days ... `,
    "..."
  );
  console.log(result);
}

// Test alternative approaches
console.log("Testing alternative implementations:");
printForecastMap(data1);
printForecastReduce(data1);
```

**Which approach do you prefer and why?**

- Loop approach: Most readable for beginners
- Map approach: Functional programming style
- Reduce approach: Most concise but harder to read

## ‚è±Ô∏è Section 2: Time-Pressured Challenge

### **Job Interview Simulation**

You have 10 minutes to solve this problem from scratch. Stay calm, apply the framework, and code step by step.

**The Challenge:**

```
SCENARIO: You're building a time tracking app for freelancers.

PROBLEM:
Create a function that analyzes a week of work hours and returns:
1. Total hours worked
2. Average daily hours
3. The day with most hours worked
4. Number of days worked (non-zero hours)
5. Whether it was a full-time week (35+ hours)

INPUT: Array of 7 numbers representing daily hours
EXAMPLE: [7.5, 8, 6.5, 0, 8.5, 4, 0]

FUNCTION NAME: analyzeWorkWeek(dailyHours)
RETURN: Object with all calculated values

TIME LIMIT: 10 minutes - START NOW!
```

### **Quick Framework Application**

- **Step 1:** Calculate 5 different metrics from hours array
- **Step 2:** Break into 5 separate calculations
- **Step 3:** Use basic array methods and Math functions
- **Step 4:** Code each calculation systematically

## üéØ Your Turn: Time-Pressured Challenge

### **Exercise: Work Hours Analyzer (10 minutes)**

**Challenge:** Build a work hours analyzer under time pressure - like a job interview!

**Your Tasks:**

1. Calculate total hours worked
2. Find average daily hours
3. Identify the day with most hours
4. Count days worked (non-zero hours)
5. Check if it was a full-time week (35+ hours)

**Time Management:**

- Apply the 4-step framework quickly
- Break into 5 separate calculations
- Use basic array methods and Math functions
- Test each calculation as you go

**Expected Result:** Object with all calculated values

```javascript
////////////////////////////////////
// TIME-PRESSURED CHALLENGE: Work Hours Analyzer

/*
JOB INTERVIEW SIMULATION:
10-minute challenge to analyze freelancer work week
Stay systematic even under pressure!
*/

function analyzeWorkWeek(dailyHours) {
  // Calculate total hours using reduce
  const totalHours = dailyHours.reduce((sum, hours) => sum + hours, 0);

  // Calculate average with proper rounding
  const averageHours = Math.round((totalHours / dailyHours.length) * 10) / 10;

  // Find maximum hours and corresponding day
  const maxHours = Math.max(...dailyHours);
  const maxDayIndex = dailyHours.indexOf(maxHours);
  const days = [
    "Monday",
    "Tuesday",
    "Wednesday",
    "Thursday",
    "Friday",
    "Saturday",
    "Sunday",
  ];
  const maxDay = days[maxDayIndex];

  // Count days worked using filter
  const daysWorked = dailyHours.filter((hours) => hours > 0).length;

  // Check if full-time week
  const isFullTime = totalHours >= 35;

  return {
    totalHours,
    averageHours,
    maxDay,
    daysWorked,
    isFullTime,
  };
}

// Test the solution
const weeklyHours = [7.5, 8, 6.5, 0, 8.5, 4, 0];
const analysis = analyzeWorkWeek(weeklyHours);
console.log("Work week analysis:", analysis);

console.log("Challenge completed under time pressure!");
```

### **Optimized Version**

After completing under pressure, here's an enhanced version:

```javascript
// Optimized version with error handling
function analyzeWorkWeekOptimized(dailyHours) {
  if (!Array.isArray(dailyHours) || dailyHours.length !== 7) {
    console.error("Invalid input: Expected array of 7 daily hours");
    return null;
  }

  const totalHours = dailyHours.reduce((sum, hours) => sum + hours, 0);
  const averageHours = Math.round((totalHours / 7) * 10) / 10;
  const maxHours = Math.max(...dailyHours);
  const maxDayIndex = dailyHours.indexOf(maxHours);
  const daysWorked = dailyHours.filter((hours) => hours > 0).length;

  const dayNames = [
    "Monday",
    "Tuesday",
    "Wednesday",
    "Thursday",
    "Friday",
    "Saturday",
    "Sunday",
  ];

  return {
    totalHours,
    averageHours,
    maxDay: dayNames[maxDayIndex],
    daysWorked,
    isFullTime: totalHours >= 35,
    workingDays: dailyHours
      .map((hours, index) => (hours > 0 ? dayNames[index] : null))
      .filter((day) => day !== null),
  };
}

const optimizedAnalysis = analyzeWorkWeekOptimized(weeklyHours);
console.log("Optimized analysis:", optimizedAnalysis);
```

## üêõ Section 3: Debug Legacy Code

### **Final Integration Challenge**

You've inherited buggy code that needs fixing. Apply all your skills: debugging methodology, systematic thinking, and enhancement techniques.

**The Scenario:**

```
You've inherited this buggy weather forecast function from another developer.
Your job: Debug it, fix all issues, and enhance it with better features.

APPLY ALL SKILLS:
- Use 5-step debugging methodology to find and fix bugs
- Research better approaches if needed
- Enhance with additional features
- Apply systematic problem-solving throughout
```

### **The Buggy Code**

```javascript
////////////////////////////////////
// FINAL INTEGRATION: Debug and Enhance Legacy Code

// Here's the buggy legacy code you need to fix
function legacyForecastFunction(temperatures) {
  // Multiple bugs hidden in this code!
  var result = "";
  for (var i = 1; i <= temperatures.length; i++) {
    result = result + temperatures[i] + " degrees in day " + i + ", ";
  }
  return result;
}

// Test the buggy function to see what goes wrong
const testData = [15, 18, 22, 19];
console.log("Buggy function output:", legacyForecastFunction(testData));
```

**Can you spot the bugs?**

1. Loop starts at 1, but arrays start at index 0
2. Loop uses `<=` which goes one element too far
3. Using `var` instead of modern `const`/`let`
4. No input validation
5. Poor string formatting approach

### **Systematic Debugging Process**

Apply the 5-step debugging methodology:

**Step 1: IDENTIFY** - Function outputs undefined values and wrong format
**Step 2: ISOLATE** - Issues in loop bounds, variable declarations, formatting
**Step 3: INVESTIGATE** - Loop starts at 1 but array indexes start at 0
**Step 4: FIX** - Correct all identified issues
**Step 5: PREVENT** - Add validation and modern practices

### **Your Fixed and Enhanced Version**

```javascript
////////////////////////////////////
// SYSTEMATIC DEBUGGING AND ENHANCEMENT

// Completely fixed and enhanced version
function enhancedForecastFunction(temperatures, options = {}) {
  // Step 5 - PREVENT: Add comprehensive input validation
  if (!Array.isArray(temperatures) || temperatures.length === 0) {
    console.error("Invalid input: temperatures must be a non-empty array");
    return "";
  }

  // Step 4 - FIX: Use modern JavaScript with proper declarations
  const { unit = "¬∞C", separator = "...", includeIndex = true } = options;

  // Step 4 - FIX: Correct loop bounds and string building
  let result = "";

  for (let i = 0; i < temperatures.length; i++) {
    const dayNumber = includeIndex ? i + 1 : i;
    result += `${temperatures[i]}${unit} in ${dayNumber} days${separator}`;
  }

  // Step 5 - PREVENT: Return clean result without trailing separator
  return separator + result.slice(0, -separator.length);
}

// Test the enhanced function with multiple configurations
console.log("Enhanced function (default):", enhancedForecastFunction(testData));
console.log(
  "Enhanced function (custom):",
  enhancedForecastFunction(testData, {
    unit: "¬∞F",
    separator: " | ",
    includeIndex: true,
  })
);

console.log("üéØ Complete developer skills successfully applied!");
console.log("Legacy code debugged, fixed, and enhanced systematically");
```
