## ‚è∞ Session Timeline

### **Opening: Developer Mindset**

Understanding what learning to code really involves and how professionals think differently.

### **Section 1: The 4-Step Framework**

Learn the systematic problem-solving approach used by every professional developer.

### **Section 2: Practical Application**

Apply the framework to solve a real thermometer problem step by step.

### **Section 3: Extended Challenge**

Practice the framework again with an enhanced version of the problem.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### **The Learning Reality Check**

Most people think coding is about memorizing syntax. Wrong. Coding is about solving problems systematically.

**The Real Learning Journey:**

- Learn basics ‚Üí Feel confident ‚Üí Try real project ‚Üí Get stuck everywhere ‚Üí Question everything ‚Üí Keep pushing through ‚Üí Gradual improvement ‚Üí Eventual success

**Key Insight:** Problem-solving matters more than syntax memorization.

### **Opening Code**

3. Google random solutions
4. Copy-paste without understanding
5. Get frustrated when nothing works

PROFESSIONAL APPROACH:
1. Understand the problem completely
2. Break into smaller sub-problems
3. Research specific solutions  
4. Implement step by step
5. Test and debug systematically

## üß† Section 1: The 4-Step Problem-Solving Framework

### **The Framework Every Professional Uses**

Every professional developer uses some version of this framework. It's not just for coding - it's for any complex problem. Master this, and you can tackle problems you've never seen before with confidence.

### **The 4 Steps**

**STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM**

- Ask the right questions until 100% clear
- Key questions:
  - What exactly needs to be accomplished?
  - What are the inputs and expected outputs?
  - What are the edge cases and constraints?
  - Are there any special requirements?
- Common mistake: Assuming you understand without clarification

**STEP 2: DIVIDE AND CONQUER**

- Break big problem into small sub-problems
- Strategy:
  - Identify the main components
  - Find dependencies between components
  - Order sub-problems logically
  - Ensure each piece is solvable independently
- Benefit: Small problems are much easier to solve

**STEP 3: RESEARCH SOLUTIONS**

- Find answers for sub-problems you cannot solve
- Best sources: MDN Documentation, Stack Overflow, Google with specific keywords
- Research tips:
  - Be specific in search terms
  - Look for official documentation first
  - Understand solutions before implementing
  - Adapt solutions to your specific case

**STEP 4: IMPLEMENT AND TEST**

- Code the solution step by step with testing
- Approach:
  - Start with the simplest sub-problem
  - Test each piece before moving on
  - Combine solutions gradually
  - Debug systematically if issues arise
- Testing mindset: Assume nothing works until proven otherwise

## üå°Ô∏è Section 2: Practical Problem-Solving Application

### **Real-World Challenge: Smart Home Thermometer**

Time for hands-on practice! We'll solve a real problem that a developer might encounter building a smart home application.

**The Problem:**

```
We work for a company building a smart home thermometer.
Our task: "Given an array of temperatures from one day,
calculate the temperature amplitude. Keep in mind that
sometimes there might be a sensor error."

Test data: [3, -2, -6, -1, 'error', 9, 13, 17, 15, 14, 9, 5]
```

### **Apply the 4-Step Framework**

**STEP 1: UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM**
Let's ask the right questions:

1. **What is temperature amplitude?**
   Answer: Difference between highest and lowest temperature

2. **How do we calculate max and min temperatures?**
   Answer: Loop through array, track highest and lowest values

3. **What's a sensor error and what to do?**
   Answer: 'error' string in data - we should ignore these values

4. **What should the function return?**
   Answer: A number representing the amplitude (max - min)

**STEP 2: BREAKING UP INTO SUB-PROBLEMS**

1. How to ignore errors? (Skip non-number values)
2. Find max value in temperature array
3. Find min value in temperature array
4. Subtract min from max (amplitude) and return it

Notice how the big scary problem became 4 simple tasks!

### **Implementation**

```javascript
////////////////////////////////////
// PRACTICAL PROBLEM-SOLVING: Smart Home Thermometer

/*
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Given an array of temperatures from one day, calculate the temperature amplitude. 
Keep in mind that sometimes there might be a sensor error.

Test data: [3, -2, -6, -1, 'error', 9, 13, 17, 15, 14, 9, 5]

STEP 1: UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM
- Temperature amplitude = difference between highest and lowest temperature
- Sensor errors = 'error' strings that should be ignored
- Return a number representing amplitude (max - min)

STEP 2: SUB-PROBLEMS
1. How to ignore errors? (Skip non-number values)
2. Find max value in temperature array
3. Find min value in temperature array  
4. Subtract min from max and return result
*/

const calcTempAmplitude = function (temps) {
  let max = temps[0];
  let min = temps[0];

  for (let i = 0; i < temps.length; i++) {
    const curTemp = temps[i];
    if (typeof curTemp !== "number") continue;

    if (curTemp > max) max = curTemp;
    if (curTemp < min) min = curTemp;
  }

  console.log(max, min);
  return max - min;
};

const temperatures = [3, -2, -6, -1, "error", 9, 13, 17, 15, 14, 9, 5];
const amplitude = calcTempAmplitude(temperatures);
console.log(amplitude);
```

**Expected Result:** Max should be 17, min should be -6, so amplitude should be 23.

## üîÑ Section 3: Extended Challenge Practice

### **New Requirement: Two Arrays**

Let's practice the framework again with changing requirements (this happens all the time in real development):

**Problem 2:**

```
Function should now receive TWO arrays of temperatures instead of one,
but still calculate the amplitude across both arrays combined.
```

### **Apply Framework Again**

**STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM**

- Do we need to implement functionality twice? NO!
- Solution: Merge the two arrays into one, then use existing logic
- Question: How do we merge two arrays in JavaScript?

**STEP 2: BREAK INTO SUB-PROBLEMS**

1. Merge two arrays into one combined array
2. Apply existing temperature amplitude logic

That's it! Very simple breakdown.

**STEP 3: RESEARCH**
Need to research: How to merge/combine two arrays in JavaScript?
Quick search reveals: `array1.concat(array2)` method

**STEP 4: IMPLEMENT**
Combine and reuse existing code.

### **Extended Implementation**

```javascript
////////////////////////////////////
// EXTENDED PROBLEM: Two Arrays

/*
PROBLEM 2: Function should handle TWO arrays of temperatures

STEP 1: UNDERSTAND - Merge arrays, then apply existing logic
STEP 2: SUB-PROBLEMS - 1) Merge arrays 2) Use existing algorithm  
STEP 3: RESEARCH - array1.concat(array2) method
STEP 4: IMPLEMENT - Combine and reuse existing code
*/

const calcTempAmplitudeNew = function (t1, t2) {
  const temps = t1.concat(t2);
  console.log(temps);

  let max = temps[0];
  let min = temps[0];

  for (let i = 0; i < temps.length; i++) {
    const curTemp = temps[i];
    if (typeof curTemp !== "number") continue;

    if (curTemp > max) max = curTemp;
    if (curTemp < min) min = curTemp;
  }

  console.log(max, min);
  return max - min;
};

const array1 = [3, 5, 1];
const array2 = [9, 0, 5];
const amplitudeNew = calcTempAmplitudeNew(array1, array2);
console.log(amplitudeNew);

console.log(
  "Problem-solving framework applied successfully to extended challenge!"
);
```
