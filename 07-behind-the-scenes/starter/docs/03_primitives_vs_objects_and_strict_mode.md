## Section 1: Stack vs Heap Memory Model

### Why This Matters

Understanding how JavaScript stores data in memory is crucial for avoiding bugs, optimizing performance, and working with complex data structures. The difference between primitives and objects explains many JavaScript behaviors that can seem confusing at first.

### Primitives vs Objects in Memory

JavaScript stores different types of data in different places in memory. Think of primitives like photocopies - each copy is completely independent. Objects are like shared Google Docs - multiple people can have the link, but they're all editing the same document.

**Primitives in the Stack:**

```javascript
// PRIMITIVES IN STACK
let age = 30;
let oldAge = age; // Independent copy
age = 31;

console.log('age:', age); // 31
console.log('oldAge:', oldAge); // 30 (unchanged!)
```

**What happens:** Primitives are stored directly in the stack. When you copy a primitive, you get a completely separate copy in a new memory slot.

**Objects in the Heap:**

```javascript
// OBJECTS IN HEAP
const me = { name: 'Jonas', age: 30 };
const friend = me; // Shared reference

friend.age = 27;

console.log('me:', me); // { name: 'Jonas', age: 27 }
console.log('friend:', friend); // { name: 'Jonas', age: 27 }
```

**What happens:** Objects are stored in the heap, and variables hold references (addresses) to the heap location. When you "copy" an object, you copy the reference, not the object itself.

### Your Turn: Test Reference Behavior

Try this example to see reference sharing in action:

```javascript
function changeAge(person, newAge) {
  person.age = newAge;
  return person;
}

const originalPerson = { name: 'Sarah', age: 25 };
const updatedPerson = changeAge(originalPerson, 30);

console.log('original:', originalPerson); // { name: 'Sarah', age: 30 } - Changed!
console.log('updated:', updatedPerson); // { name: 'Sarah', age: 30 } - Same object!
console.log('same object?:', originalPerson === updatedPerson); // true
```

**Key insight:** Functions receive references to objects, not copies. This means functions can modify the original objects passed to them.

**Challenge:** Why does `const` allow us to modify the object's properties? (Hint: `const` prevents reassignment of the variable, not mutation of the object it points to)

## Section 2: Shallow vs Deep Copying

### Why This Matters

Understanding copying behavior helps you avoid unexpected mutations and choose the right technique for your needs. Sometimes you want shared references, sometimes you need independent copies.

### Shallow Copying Techniques

Shallow copying creates a new object but nested objects/arrays are still shared. It's called "shallow" because it only goes one level deep.

```javascript
const original = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 28,
  hobbies: ['reading', 'coding'],
};

// Spread operator shallow copy
const shallowCopy = { ...original };

shallowCopy.name = 'Bob';
console.log('original name:', original.name); // 'Alice' (unchanged)
console.log('copy name:', shallowCopy.name); // 'Bob' (changed)

// But nested objects are still shared
shallowCopy.hobbies.push('gaming');
console.log('original hobbies:', original.hobbies); // ['reading', 'coding', 'gaming'] - Changed!
console.log('copy hobbies:', shallowCopy.hobbies); // ['reading', 'coding', 'gaming'] - Same array!

// Object.assign alternative
const anotherCopy = Object.assign({}, original);
console.log('Object.assign copy:', anotherCopy);
```

**When to use shallow copying:** Perfect for objects with only primitive values (strings, numbers, booleans). Also fine when you know you won't modify nested objects.

### Deep Copying Solutions

For complete independence, we need deep copying - copying all levels including nested objects and arrays.

```javascript
const deepOriginal = {
  name: 'Charlie',
  age: 32,
  address: { city: 'Paris', country: 'France' },
  hobbies: ['travel', 'photography'],
};

// Modern deep copy with structuredClone
const deepCopy = structuredClone(deepOriginal);

deepCopy.address.city = 'London';
deepCopy.hobbies.push('cooking');

console.log('original address:', deepOriginal.address); // { city: 'Paris', country: 'France' }
console.log('copy address:', deepCopy.address); // { city: 'London', country: 'France' }
console.log('original hobbies:', deepOriginal.hobbies); // ['travel', 'photography']
console.log('copy hobbies:', deepCopy.hobbies); // ['travel', 'photography', 'cooking']
```

### Common Pitfall: JSON Methods

Many developers try to use JSON methods for deep copying, but this has limitations:

```javascript
const problemObject = {
  name: 'Test',
  date: new Date(),
  method: function () {
    return 'hello';
  },
  undefinedValue: undefined,
};

// BROKEN: JSON method loses data
const brokenCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(problemObject));
console.log('Broken copy:', brokenCopy);
// { name: 'Test', date: '2023-...' } - Lost method and undefined!

// FIXED: structuredClone preserves most types
const workingCopy = structuredClone(problemObject);
console.log('Working copy:', workingCopy);
// Note: functions still can't be cloned, but dates work!
```

**Rule of Thumb:**

- **Shallow copy** ‚Üí spread `{...obj}` or `Object.assign({}, obj)`
- **Deep copy** ‚Üí `structuredClone(obj)` for modern browsers
- **Arrays** ‚Üí same rules apply: `[...arr]` (shallow) vs `structuredClone(arr)` (deep)

### Your Turn: Copying Challenge

Create a user management system that safely handles user data:

```javascript
const userManager = {
  users: [],

  addUser: function (userData) {
    // Your task: Add userData to users array
    // But make sure external changes to userData don't affect stored data
    // Hint: Use deep copying
  },

  getUsers: function () {
    // Your task: Return users array
    // But prevent external code from modifying the original array
    // Hint: Use shallow copying for the array
  },
};

// Test your implementation
const originalUser = { name: 'John', preferences: { theme: 'dark' } };
userManager.addUser(originalUser);

originalUser.name = 'Modified';
console.log('Original changed:', originalUser);
console.log('Stored user:', userManager.getUsers()[0]); // Should still be 'John'!
```

## Section 3: Strict Mode Benefits & Integration

### Why This Matters

Strict mode has been helping us throughout all three hours by making JavaScript more predictable and catching errors early. Understanding its benefits helps you write better, more reliable code.

### Strict Mode Throughout All Concepts

Let's see how strict mode has been protecting us:

```javascript
'use strict';

// 1. Hoisting and TDZ (Hour 1)
// Without strict mode: undeclaredVar = 'This would create a global variable!';
// With strict mode: throws ReferenceError
// undeclaredVar = 'This throws an error in strict mode';

// 2. This keyword (Hour 2)
function demonstrateThis() {
  console.log('this in strict mode:', this); // undefined (not global object)
}
demonstrateThis();

// 3. Object mutation prevention attempts
const readOnlyObj = Object.freeze({ name: 'Frozen' });

try {
  readOnlyObj.name = 'Changed'; // Throws error in strict mode
  console.log('Mutation succeeded');
} catch (error) {
  console.log('Strict mode caught error:', error.message);
}
```

### Real-World Integration Example

Here's a practical example combining all concepts from the three hours:

```javascript
const userManager = {
  users: [],

  addUser: function (userData) {
    // Deep copy to avoid reference issues
    const userCopy = structuredClone(userData);
    this.users.push(userCopy);
    return this; // Method chaining
  },

  getUsers: function () {
    // Return shallow copy to prevent external mutation
    return [...this.users];
  },
};

// Test the complete system
const originalUser = { name: 'John', preferences: { theme: 'dark' } };
userManager.addUser(originalUser);

originalUser.name = 'Modified';
console.log('Original changed:', originalUser);
console.log('Stored user:', userManager.getUsers()[0]); // Still 'John'!
```

**What this demonstrates:**

- **Memory management:** Deep copying prevents reference issues
- **`this` keyword:** Methods correctly bind to the userManager object
- **Strict mode:** Catches errors and prevents silent failures
- **Professional patterns:** Method chaining and safe data handling

## üìä Git Commit Time!

### Step 1: Stage All Changes

```bash
git add .
```

**What this does:**

- Stages all modified files in your current directory
- Prepares them for commit (like putting items in a shopping cart)
- The `.` means "all files in current directory and subdirectories"
- You'll see: `modified: script.js` in the output

### Step 2: Commit Your Changes

```bash
git commit
```

**What happens:**

- Opens your default text editor (usually VS Code or vim)
- You'll see a commit message template
- Replace the template with your message
- Save and close the editor to complete the commit

**If you see vim editor (most common):**

1. **Enter Insert Mode:**

   - Press `i` to enter insert mode
   - You'll see `-- INSERT --` at the bottom of the screen
   - Now you can type and edit text normally

2. **Edit the commit message:**

   - Delete the existing template text (use Backspace or Delete keys)
   - Type your new commit message
   - You can use arrow keys to navigate

3. **Save and exit:**

   - Press `Esc` to exit insert mode
   - Type `:wq` and press Enter
   - This saves the file and quits vim

**If you see VS Code editor:**

- Simply edit the message directly
- Press `Ctrl+S` (or `Cmd+S` on Mac) to save
- Close the tab to complete the commit

**If you make a mistake:**

- Press `Esc` to exit insert mode
- Type `:q!` and press Enter to quit without saving
- This will cancel the commit and you can try again

**Your commit message:**

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

- **"Why can I modify a `const` object?"**

  - **Cause**: `const` prevents reassignment of the variable, not mutation of the object
  - **Fix**: Use `Object.freeze()` to prevent mutations, or understand that `const` only protects the reference

- **"Shallow copy not working as expected"**

  - **Cause**: Trying to use shallow copy on objects with nested structures
  - **Fix**: Use `structuredClone()` for deep copying when you have nested objects/arrays

- **"JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()) losing data"**

  - **Cause**: JSON can only represent certain data types (loses functions, dates become strings, etc.)
  - **Fix**: Use `structuredClone()` for modern browsers or a proper deep cloning library

- **"Function parameter modifying original object"**

  - **Cause**: Objects are passed by reference, not by value
  - **Fix**: Create a copy inside the function if you need to avoid mutations

- **"Unexpected object mutations"**
  - **Cause**: Multiple variables pointing to the same object reference
  - **Fix**: Use appropriate copying technique (shallow vs deep) based on your data structure
